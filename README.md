# Mobirise-Configurable-Bootstrap-Menu

## <b>Compatibility</b><br>
This extension works with Mobirise themes based on Bootstrap 4 (AMP not supported). It might work on other versions, but no guarantees.

## <b>Who can use</b><br>
Please note this is a TEST verion only being tested by a few known contributors.

## <b>Notes</b><br>
A Mobirise Bootstrap menu with many configuration settings available from the "gear" configuration icon. It includes individual colour and opacity settings for main, sub-menu and Hamburger menu background, individual underline colour and thickness for main and sub-menu plus sub-menu % darken on hover. This menu also has options to enable button and social icons within the menu....plus other configurable settings. In summary, you can configure more options on the gear icon than you can with the standard menus. This was a personal training exercise for me to configure gear items and also upload to GitHub.

## <b>Installation and use</b><br>
This is a zip file containing a Mobirise 4.x bootstrap project. To use the menu, download the zip file, unzip contents to a folder and import into Mobirise as a new project by selecting the "project.mobirise" file for the import process. You can then save the menu as a "user block" and move between bootstrap projects (AMP not supported).
