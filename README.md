# Mobirise-Configurable-Bootstrap-Menu
A Mobirise Bootstrap menu with many configuration settings available from the "gear" configuration icon. It includes individual colour and opacity settings for main, sub-menu and Hamburger Menu background, individual underline colour and thickness for main and sub-menu plus sub-menu % darken on hover. This menu also has options to enable button and social icons within the menu....plus other configurable settings. In summary, you can configure more options on the gear icon than you can with the standard menus. This was a personal training exercise for me to configure gear items and also upload to the design gallery.
