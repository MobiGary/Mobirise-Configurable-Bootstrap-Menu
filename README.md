# Mobirise-Configurable-Bootstrap-Menu

## <b>Latest Version</b><br>
v1.9 as detailed in the changelog:
https://github.com/MobiGary/Mobirise-Configurable-Bootstrap-Menu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md

## <b>Compatibility</b><br>
This extension works with Mobirise themes based on Bootstrap 4 (AMP not supported). It might work on other versions, but no guarantees.

## <b>Who can use</b><br>
Feel free to give it a try if you are a Mobirise Bootstrap 4 user.

## <b>Notes</b><br>
A Mobirise Bootstrap menu with many configuration settings available from the "gear" configuration icon. It includes:
- Individual colour and opacity settings for Main, Sub and Hamburger menu background.
- Individual underline colour and thickness for main and sub-menu plus sub-menu % darken on hover.
- Options to enable button and social icons within the menu.
- Set Logo size & Set logo size when scrolling down page options.
- Allows alignment of main menu when is desktop mode to eitehr left, center or right. Menu item spacing slider also provided.
- Menu undrline options.
- Main Menu and Sub Menu underline options.
- Sub Menu rounded corner optons.
- Main and Sub Menu Box shadow (inner and outer) options.

In summary, you can configure more options on the gear icon than you can with the standard menus. This was a personal training exercise for me to configure gear items and also upload to GitHub.

## <b>Installation and use</b><br>
This is a zip file containing a small Mobirise 4.x bootstrap project (created using the Mobirise 4 theme as the base project). To use the menu, download the zip file, unzip contents to a folder and import into Mobirise as a new project by selecting the "project.mobirise" file for the import process. You can then save the menu from the imported project as a Mobirise "user block" and move between Mobirise bootstrap 4 projects (AMP not supported). 

Once the block configuaration is accessed via the "gear" (cog) icon, all the configuration options are avaiable (see screenshot in link above).
