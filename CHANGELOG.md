## TEST Version 20200420 (2020-APRIL-20)

- Added "Menu BoxShadow Inner Location" enhancement on the cog allowing you to specifiy "Bottom Only" or "All 4 Sides".

## TEST Version 20200420 (2020-APRIL-19)

- Added "Logo Size Scroll Sticky" extra slider. In addition to the existing cog item to control the Logo image size the cog also now has a “Logo Size Scroll Sticky” slider. This allows you to set the size of the logo for when/if you use sticky mode. It changes the logo size as you scroll down the page and the menu stays stuck – the overall result is the amount the menu shrinks or grows in height on scroll is now configurable from the cog for desktop mode operation of the menu. You could therefore select a smaller/same size/larger logo size on sticky scroll to control exactly how the sticky menu scroll looks. 

- Added "Menu BoxShadow Inner" as well as "Menu BoxShadow Outer" cog options. Allows you to control the color and opacity of the main menu & sub menu inner and outer box-shadow individually. Can be set between 0 and 1 in increments so if you only want one of the shadows for example set the one you don't want to 0.
