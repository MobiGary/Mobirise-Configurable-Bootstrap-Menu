# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Version 1.0 (2020-APRIL-20)

- After testing, published latest version as v1.0

## TEST Version 20200420 (2020-APRIL-20)

- Added "Menu BoxShadow Inner Location" enhancement on the cog allowing you to specifiy "Bottom Only" or "All 4 Sides".

## TEST Version 20200419 (2020-APRIL-19)

- Added "Logo Size Scroll Sticky" extra slider. In addition to the existing cog item to control the Logo image size the cog also now has a “Logo Size Scroll Sticky” slider. This allows you to set the size of the logo for when/if you use sticky mode. It changes the logo size as you scroll down the page and the menu stays stuck – the overall result is the amount the menu shrinks or grows in height on scroll is now configurable from the cog for desktop mode operation of the menu. You could therefore select a smaller/same size/larger logo size on sticky scroll to control exactly how the sticky menu scroll looks. 

- Added "Menu BoxShadow Inner" as well as "Menu BoxShadow Outer" cog options. Allows you to control the color and opacity of the main menu & sub menu inner and outer box-shadow individually. Can be set between 0 and 1 in increments so if you only want one of the shadows for example set the one you don't want to 0. 

## TEST Version 20200417 (2020-APRIL-17)

- Addition of a cog item "SubMenu Item Hover" giving a toggle if a hover color over text required or not. If enabled a color selector is then displayed below it.

- Addition of a cog item "MainMenu Hover Underline Thickness". Allows the thickness of the hover underline to be set. It was fixed at 1px before (if option enabled). Now variable from cog.

- Changed the step values of some cog items to give greater granular control.

- Various enhancements to look and feel of "main menu collapsed mode" when enabled.

## TEST Version 20200416v2 (2020-APRIL-16)

- Changed hover so menu items that have social icons next to them also hover in same colour seected in the cog. Previously there was a hover conflict with the CSS setting iconfont hover colour (selecting what was chosen in the main menu for all iconfonts in all menus). Faulty part of CSS removed now.

## TEST Version 20200416 (2020-APRIL-16)

- The "Collapsed" cog item is back.

- Some spelling mistakes on the cog have been corrected.

- In desktop mode (not mobile) if you use icons on your menus as well as text, when you hover over a menu link that has both text+icon, the hover color changes to the on-hover "Main Menu Item Hover" color cog item both together (rather than separately as before).

- Removed the cog item to set icon color as this was partly to blame for the issue above (in conjunction with the associated CSS). So now if you wish to set a social icon color (if you use them in the menu) just click on the social icon and set it manually.

## TEST Version 20200420v2 (2020-APRIL-14)

- Added box-shadow menu cog optioon.

## TEST Version v20200420 (2020-APRIL-14)

- This is the initial release of the MobiGary Mobirise Configurable Menu for Mobirise.
